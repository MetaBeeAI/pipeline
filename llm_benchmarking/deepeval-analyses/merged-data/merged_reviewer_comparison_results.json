During the treatment phase, individually marked foragers were observed for 3 hours. Foraging behavior, waggle dancing, and site fidelity were video-recorded and analyzed using ImageJ.

Daily colony weight dynamics were recorded every 5 minutes, and hive temperature was monitored every 30 min. Abiotic parameters from the two environments were also recorded (rainfall and average daily temperatures).

Two weeks after the treatment started, colonies (with thymol treatment or thymol + imidacloprid treatment) recieved an aluminium tray with Apiguard gel. The Apiguard gel was renewed after 2 weeks, but it is unclear from the text how many times this was repeated. The experiment ran for around 9 months and during most of this time, hives were evaluated once a month. The treatment started 4 weeks after the first evaluation. Hives were placed on scales before the experiment, for continous weight measurements and temperature sensors continously recorded temperature data. During the evaluations additional data were recorded on capped brood area, and pollen and honey surface. On four occations, they measured Varroa destructor.

In the short term, thiacloprid exposure increased responses to the floral VOCs benzyl-alcohol and 1-hexanol, which are also found in honeybee sting gland secretions. Responses to QMP and alarm pheromone 2-heptanone were also affected. The response signal to the positive control citral also degenerated more quickly in thiacloprid exposed bees over the short term. The only long-term effect of pesticide exposure was a decrease in responsiveness to methyl salicylate in Thiacloprid exposed bees. Imidacloprid exposure induced no effects on antennal responses. The study also obserbed season-related differences in antennal responses to several VOCs and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. The authors conclude that their observation of volatile-specific chanmges in antennal responses may contribute to previously observed changes in the behaviour of neonicotinoid-exposed bees.",

Immunosuppressive effects were only observed in females at concentrations of 555 ug/kg. This may be explained by the fact that males consumed more of the spiked sucrose solution, leading to a 2.77 times higher exposure compared to females. Exposure to thiacloprid did not affect the melanisation or wound healing response in either sex. Since only food consumption of females is typically considered in regulatory risk assessments, these results suggest that males should also be included in future risk assessment schemes for the approval and authorisation of pesticide use.

The negative effect of thiacloprid on colony fitness was confirmed under field conditions, where thiacloprid affected the production of reproductives, colony weight gain, worker weight, and foraging behaviour. For acetamiprid, a negative trend on colony fitness could only be shown in a field setup.",

They found that the results with microcolonies contradicted the results with queenright colonies, and that different effects were found during short vs. long term experiments highlighting the need for long term experimnets in risk assessments and the potential for underestimating risk when using microcolonies. The effects of thiacloprid on the fitness of queenright colonies was also confirmed by the field experiment, and the negative effects of acetamiprid were only apparent under field conditions.

The authors suggest that to confirm that there are true seasonal trends in responsiveness to VOCs as they observed between autumn and spring would require a repetition of the study over multiple years. They also suggest that to determine the mechanism underpinning such seasonal variation, there should be an investigation of the type, distribution and number of sensilla during the year. They also suggest that future research should be conducted to determine how neonicotinoid exposure affects olfactory receptors, given the results contrast with findings and conclusions from previous studies regarding chemical specific responses of VOC receptors. They suggest using calcium imaging of ORN signals in the antennal lobe. To determine whether pesticides also impact learning at the periphery of the olfactory system i.e. through reduced cue detection the authors suggest combined studies of behaviour and EAG responses should be conducted in future. They also suggest future EAG experiment focusing specifically on alarm pheremone responses are needed to examine how neonicotinoids affect alarm pheremone sensitivity, since thiacloprid exposure only affected the response to one component.",

Two weeks after the treatment started, colonies (with thymol treatment or thymol + imidacloprid treatment) recieved an aluminium tray with Apiguard gel.

The experiment ran for around 9 months and during most of this time, hives were evaluated once a month. The treatment started 4 weeks after the first evaluation. Hives were placed on scales before the experiment, for continous weight measurements and temperature sensors continously recorded temperature data. During the evaluations additional data were recorded on capped brood area, and pollen and honey surface. On four occations, they measured Varroa destructor.

Males exposed to concentrations above 200 ug/kg showed a reduction in hemocyte density and an impairement in the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph. Immunosuppressive effects were only observed in females at concentrations of 555 ug/kg. This may be explained by the fact that males consumed more of the spiked sucrose solution, leading to a 2.77 times higher exposure compared to females. Exposure to thiacloprid did not affect the melanisation or wound healing response in either sex. Since only food consumption of females is typically considered in regulatory risk assessments, these results suggest that males should also be included in future risk assessment schemes for the approval and authorisation of pesticide use. The authors also emphasise the importance of studying non-Apis bees since they may respond differently and yet are still important contributers to crop and wild plant pollination.",

In the short term, thiacloprid exposure increased responses to the floral VOCs benzyl-alcohol and 1-hexanol, which are also found in honeybee sting gland secretions. Responses to QMP and alarm pheromone 2-heptanone were also affected. The response signal to the positive control citral also degenerated more quickly in thiacloprid exposed bees over the short term. The only long-term effect of pesticide exposure was a decrease in responsiveness to methyl salicylate in Thiacloprid exposed bees. Imidacloprid exposure induced no effects on antennal responses. The study also obserbed season-related differences in antennal responses to several VOCs and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone.

Bees treated with thiamethoxam however, did not develop an efficient route to the reward. This implies that sub-lethal treatment with thiamethoxam effects spatial learning and memory, which could impact foraging efficiency. They also increased their post-tarining speeds, implying hyperactivity. \n\nSub-lethal sulfloxaflor exposure was not found to effect any of the parameters measured, making it a good candidate to replace neonicotinoids.

The effects of thiacloprid on the fitness of queenright colonies was also confirmed by the field experiment, and the negative effects of acetamiprid were only apparent under field conditions.

They also suggest that to determine the mechanism underpinning such seasonal variation, there should be an investigation of the type, distribution and number of sensilla during the year. They also suggest that future research should be conducted to determine how neonicotinoid exposure affects olfactory receptors, given the results contrast with findings and conclusions from previous studies regarding chemical specific responses of VOC receptors. They suggest using calcium imaging of ORN signals in the antennal lobe. To determine whether pesticides also impact learning at the periphery of the olfactory system i.e. through reduced cue detection the authors suggest combined studies of behaviour and EAG responses should be conducted in future. They also suggest future EAG experiment focusing specifically on alarm pheremone responses are needed to examine how neonicotinoids affect alarm pheremone sensitivity, since thiacloprid exposure only affected the response to one component.",
