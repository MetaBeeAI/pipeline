      "Completeness [GEval]": "The Actual Output covers the use of both field and lab experiments and mentions the injection of pollen with pesticides, aligning with the Expected Output's description of methodologies. However, it omits key details: it does not specify the use of imidacloprid in field experiments for Osmia lignaria, nor does it mention the use of clothianidin in M. rotundata laboratory experiments. The Actual Output also lacks detail on the exposure to different doses and the distinction between the two pesticides used for the two bee species. Thus, while the main methods are addressed, important specifics are missing.",
      "Accuracy [GEval]": "The Actual Output correctly identifies that both field and lab experiments were used and that pollen was injected with pesticides. However, it omits key details from the Expected Output, such as the specific pesticides used (imidacloprid for O. lignaria in the field and lab, clothianidin for M. rotundata in the lab), and does not mention that M. rotundata was only tested in the lab with clothianidin. The Actual Output also generalizes the methods and does not specify the exposure to different doses. These omissions and generalizations result in partial but incomplete alignment with the Expected Output."

    "actual_output": "A field study was conducted in two different locations (Tucson, Arizona; Sydney, Australia) to assess colony level effects of trace levels of imidacloprid, the commercial miticide thymol (Apiguard), and their combination. Over a full year, the authors recorded worker and brood populations, as well as food stores, every four weeks by photographing both sides of each frame after brushing off the bees. Daily colony weight dynamics were recorded every 5 minutes, and hive temperature was monitored every 30 min. Abiotic parameters from the two environments were also recorded (rainfall and average daily temperatures). In Tucson, Varroa destructor mite falls were measured using sticky boards in all hives, while no Varroa mites were not detected in Sydney. Honey, wax and bees were collected for to pesticide residue analysis using HPLC-MS/MS.",
    "expected_output": "22 honeybee colonies were used for the experiment south of Tucson, USA and 16 honeybee colonies north of Sydney, Australia. Hive location as well as hive tratment were randomised across the apiary. Colonies were fed sucrose solution either with imidacloprid (imidacloprid or imidacloprid + thymol treatment) or without imidacloprid (control or thymol treatment) inside the hive for 6 weeks. Two weeks after the treatment started, colonies (with thymol treatment or thymol + imidacloprid treatment) recieved an aluminium tray with Apiguard gel. The Apiguard gel was renewed after 2 weeks, but it is unclear from the text how many times this was repeated. The experiment ran for around 9 months and during most of this time, hives were evaluated once a month. The treatment started 4 weeks after the first evaluation. Hives were placed on scales before the experiment, for continous weight measurements and temperature sensors continously recorded temperature data. During the evaluations additional data were recorded on capped brood area, and pollen and honey surface. On four occations, they measured Varroa destructor. In the US, samples of honey and was were analyzed for pesticide residues.",

However, it omits specific details from the Expected Output: the exact number of colonies per site, the randomization of hive location and treatment, the sucrose feeding protocol, the timing and renewal of Apiguard gel, the 4-week pre-treatment evaluation, the 6-week treatment duration, and the 9-month total experiment length. It also lacks mention of the frequency and timing of Varroa measurements and the specific data collected during evaluations (capped brood area, pollen, honey surface). Thus, while the main experimental design is described, several important procedural details are missing or only partially addressed.",

The Actual Output also lacks details on the timing of treatment initiation and the frequency of Varroa measurements. Some details, like the use of HPLC-MS/MS for residue analysis, are present, but the Actual Output is less specific about the experimental design and schedule, leading to partial alignment."
