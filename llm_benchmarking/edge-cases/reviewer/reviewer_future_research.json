There should be a focus on ecologically relevant endpoints, and further investigation of the interactions between different agrochemicals using field and semi-field methods, and an assessment of the implications of environmental conditions on pesticide toxicity.. The authors conclude that the evaluation of synergies between pesticides in real world settings, particularly on sublethal endpoints will require the refinement of statistical methods. The authors also suggest that further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underpinning their finding that pestcide exposure affected mean number of offspring per nest, but not total number of offspring per enclosure. Furthermore, research is also needed to determine whether the interactive effects of pesticides on offspring emergence is due to food deprivation, impaired detoxicification or a combination of these factors.",
