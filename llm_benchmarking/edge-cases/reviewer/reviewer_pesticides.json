However, it omits key details present in the Expected Output: the active ingredients and their concentrations, the fact that formulations were given singly and in combination, the use of 30% sucrose solution, the specific per-bee/day dosages, and the one-week exposure duration (noted as missing). The exposure method is only partially described. Thus, while some main points are covered, several important specifics are missing.",
      "Accuracy [GEval]": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the pesticides used, their commercial names, and the dose levels for both Cantus\u00ae Gold and Mospilan\u00ae. However, it omits key details present in the Expected Output, such as the active ingredients and their concentrations, the specific per-bee dosing, the fact that formulations were given singly and in combination, the use of 30% sucrose solution, and the one-week exposure duration. The Actual Output also notes that the exposure duration is not specified, which is inaccurate since the Expected Output clearly states it. Thus, while the main pesticides and dose levels are correct, several important experimental details are missing or incorrect."
