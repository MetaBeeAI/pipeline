      "Correctness [GEval]": "Actual Output lists incorrect dose range (50-500 mg/L, LC50 188.49 mg/L) instead of 0, 5, 25 mg/L, and gives wrong exposure duration (72 hours) instead of four days; also mentions flumethrin, which is not in Expected Output.",
      "Completeness [GEval]": "The Actual Output correctly identifies acetamiprid as the pesticide used, partially aligning with the Expected Output. However, it fails to mention the specific concentrations tested (0, 5, and 25 mg/L), the oral exposure method via sucrose solution, and the four-day exposure duration. Instead, it provides unrelated information about recommended doses, LC50, and mentions flumethrin, which is not relevant to the key points. Several key details from the Expected Output are missing or incomplete.",
      "Accuracy [GEval]": "The actual output correctly identifies acetamiprid as the pesticide used, but it provides incorrect concentration ranges (50-500 mg/L and LC50 of 188.49 mg/L) instead of the expected 0, 5, and 25 mg/L. It also omits the exposure method (oral via sucrose solution) and the correct exposure duration (four days, not 72 hours). The mention of flumethrin is extraneous and not present in the expected output, further reducing accuracy."

The doses were: imidacloprid (median: 3 \u00b5g/kg in soils, 168 \u00b5g/kg in soybean flowers in 2018) and clothianidin (median: 27 \u00b5g/kg in treated fields, 20 \u00b5g/kg in previously-treated fields).

Neonicotinoid treated fields were sown with imidacloprid seed treatments at a rate of 0.10 kg AI/ha in the formulation Gaucho (Bayer Crop Science). Fields were either untreated (no prior neonicotinoid use), previously-treated (last use of neonicotinoids in 2016) or treated (continuously cropped with neonicotinoid seeds for >5 years).",

However, it omits key details from the Expected Output, such as the soybean planting rate, row spacing, specific seed treatment rate (0.10 kg AI/ha), the formulation used (Gaucho), and the definition of untreated fields. The classification of field types is only partially addressed, and important methodological specifics are missing.",
      "Accuracy [GEval]": "The actual output mentions the pesticides used (imidacloprid and clothianidin), their doses, exposure method, and duration, but omits key details from the expected output such as the soybean planting rate, row spacing, specific seed treatment rate (0.10 kg AI/ha), formulation (Gaucho), and the precise definitions of field treatment categories. It also adds some information about residue levels not present in the expected output. This results in partial alignment but significant omissions and some extraneous details."
