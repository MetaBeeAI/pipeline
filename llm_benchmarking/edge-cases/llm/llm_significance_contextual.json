Males exposed to concentrations above 200 ug/kg showed a reduction in hemocyte density and an impairement in the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph. Immunosuppressive effects were only observed in females at concentrations of 555 ug/kg. This may be explained by the fact that males consumed more of the spiked sucrose solution, leading to a 2.77 times higher exposure compared to females. Exposure to thiacloprid did not affect the melanisation or wound healing response in either sex. Since only food consumption of females is typically considered in regulatory risk assessments, these results suggest that males should also be included in future risk assessment schemes for the approval and authorisation of pesticide use.
