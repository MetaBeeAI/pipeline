**LLM Analysis:**

**Section 1: Main Issues**

1. **Lack of Specificity**: Many responses fail to provide the precise species or subspecies required, often substituting general terms like "honeybees" instead of the specific scientific names or subspecies, leading to inaccuracies and incompleteness.
   
2. **Inclusion of Unrelated Species**: Responses frequently introduce additional, unrelated species not mentioned in the expected output, which results in factual inaccuracies and a failure to focus on the key species or subspecies required.

3. **Omission of Key Details**: Critical details such as subspecies, scientific names, or specific descriptors (e.g., "Africanized") are often omitted, leading to incomplete responses that do not fully align with the expected output.

**Section 2: Recommendations for Improving Prompt**

1. **Emphasize Specificity**: Clearly instruct the model to provide exact scientific names and subspecies, avoiding general terms or common names unless specified.

2. **Limit Scope**: Direct the model to focus solely on the species or subspecies mentioned in the prompt, explicitly stating that additional species should not be included unless requested.

3. **Highlight Key Details**: Ensure the prompt emphasizes the importance of including all relevant descriptors and details, such as subspecies or hybrid information, to improve completeness and accuracy.

**LLM Analysis:**

**Section 1: Main Issues**

1. **Lack of Alignment and Specificity**: Many responses fail to align with the Expected Output, either by omitting key research directions or introducing unrequested details, leading to discrepancies in correctness and accuracy. This includes missing specific research topics or incorrectly adding unrelated information.

2. **Incomplete Coverage**: Responses often do not cover all the critical points outlined in the Expected Output, resulting in incomplete answers. This includes failing to mention specific research areas, methodologies, or species that are crucial for comprehensive future research suggestions.

3. **Inaccurate Content**: There are frequent factual inconsistencies where the Actual Output either misrepresents the Expected Output or lacks the necessary specificity, such as omitting particular species, chemicals, or mechanisms that are central to the research focus.

**Section 2: Recommendations for Improving Prompt**

1. **Clarify Expected Details**: Ensure the prompt explicitly outlines the specific research areas, methodologies, and species that need to be addressed. This will help guide responses to focus on the necessary details without introducing unrelated content.

2. **Emphasize Completeness**: Encourage responses to systematically address all key points from the Expected Output. This can be achieved by structuring the prompt to highlight each critical area that needs to be covered.

3. **Enhance Specificity**: Direct the prompt to require precise alignment with the Expected Output, avoiding generalizations and ensuring that responses are factually consistent and detailed, particularly regarding specific research directions and methodologies.
