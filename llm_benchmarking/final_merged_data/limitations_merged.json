    "answer_rev1": "The lack of standard protocols for use in PPP research in bumblebees is highlighted as a general limitation in the field. The methods reported here use a categorization method that is not suited to detecting small differences in bee numbers and so the endpoint here may be less biologically relevant. The effects on overwintering and breeding success were also not directly measured in this study. The measures used to determine reproductive success were new queen numbers and number of queen brood cells. The weight of individual queens was not recorded due to the experimental set up here, but is considered a good proxy for determining colony fitness by other studies. The logistics and costs of big landscape-scale studies, such as this one may limit how often they can repeated or performed.",

    "answer_rev1": "Acute toxicity (LD50s) tests are important in generating toxicity data but do not detect the sub-lethal effects of chronic pesticide exposure and even this modified protocol would not pick up interactions between chronic exposure and bee parasites. The number of different bee parasites makes testing interactions between agrochemicals and all of them impractical. The lack of understanding of parasite life-history is also a limiting factor.

It emphasizes the need for more robust field studies and comprehensive residue data collection to accurately assess risks to pollinators.",
    "answer_rev1": "The authors identified three main limitations in the study related to the low exposure toxicity ratio (ETR) values observed. First, during all study periods, honey bees had access to non-sprayed areas for foraging. Second, no other pesticide-treated crops were present in the study area. Third, the study was conducted during a period of low nectar and pollen income. As a result, the authors emphasized that the generally low risk to honey bees should be interpreted with caution.",
    "answer_rev2": "The authors do discuss limitation of their results: Nevertheless, these results must be interpreted with caution, since (1) in all study windows, honey bees had non-sprayed areas to forage; (2) no other crop fields with pesticides' input were inside the study areas, limiting cross contamination and possible synergistic effects caused by other chemicals (e.g., Wang et al., 2020); and (3) the study was performed in a period where nectar and pollen income might not be so high as during the peak of flowering.",
