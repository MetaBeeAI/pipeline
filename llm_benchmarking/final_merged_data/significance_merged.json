No difference in hive weight, or numbers of workers produced were observed. No effect on numbers of young queens produced were observed in the post-exposure phase. Under field-realistic conditions used here clothianidin residue aws lower than often suggested by other studies (max 1.3ug/kg in pollen).

Bioassay 2 methodology was also inferior to bioassay 3 as there was >90% control mortality after 12 hours (probably due to the time spent in the freezer and damage to bees from the transfer from collection pots into experimental flasks). Therefore bioassy 3 was flagged as being the appropriate one to use.\n\nChlorantraniliprole aws found to be less toxic to T. travancorica than thiamethoxam. T. travancorica was also found to more sensitive to thiamethoxam than A. mellifera. Bees from the feral colony (no previous insecticide exposure) were more suscepible to thiamethoxam than bees from the vegetable ecostsyem colony (with regular potential insecticide exposure).

This is important as P. lucii colonies are made up of fewer workers than those of other eusocial bees, making the loss of workers more significant in terms of colony-success. P. lucii is a very small bee (length 3mm) and is more at risk from pesticides, not only directly because of their size, but also beacuse a small body size limits their flight range and foraging area, making them remain in pesticide treated areas rather than moving away. \n\nWalking and flight behaviours were negative effected by spinosad exposure, but no effect on body mass or respiration was observed. \n\nOverall this species interaction with pesticides deserves attention to ensure its conservation and the health of its ecosystem.",

Sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid and sulfoxaflor did not effect the bees ability to respond to aversive training (reducing distance travellled to  reward) and were not associated with hyperactive behaviours. Bees treated with thiamethoxam however, did not develop an efficient route to the reward. This implies that sub-lethal treatment with thiamethoxam effects spatial learning and memory, which could impact foraging efficiency. They also increased their post-tarining speeds, implying hyperactivity. \n\nSub-lethal sulfloxaflor exposure was not found to effect any of the parameters measured, making it a good candidate to replace neonicotinoids.

    "answer_rev1": "This study confirmed that exposure to clothianidin leads to the increased production of vitellogenin protein (not simply increased RNA transcription). There was a 3-fold induction of full-length vitellogenin (180k-Da) in the fat body and significant increased production of lighter (150-kDa) vitellogenin in the brain. This lighter vitellogenein is not found in the brain of unexposed bees. The lighter version is proposed to be a cleaved (processed) form of the protein, perhaps associated with larval feeding by nurse bees (and might be used as a marker for nurse bees). Clothianidin led to differential induction of vitellogenin protein in different tissues.\n\nForager bees normally have lower vitellogenin levels than nurse bees, but exposure of foragers to clothianidin induced a nurse-bee-like phenotype. This could have significant physiological consequences for worker bees, as vitellogenin is involved in stress management, protection against oxidative stress and life-span.\n\nThe devlopment of the antibody used in this study can be used to analyse the effects of other pesticides on vitellogenin expression and function.",

Males exposed to concentrations above 200 ug/kg showed a reduction in hemocyte density and an impairement in the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph. Immunosuppressive effects were only observed in females at concentrations of 555 ug/kg. This may be explained by the fact that males consumed more of the spiked sucrose solution, leading to a 2.77 times higher exposure compared to females. Exposure to thiacloprid did not affect the melanisation or wound healing response in either sex. Since only food consumption of females is typically considered in regulatory risk assessments, these results suggest that males should also be included in future risk assessment schemes for the approval and authorisation of pesticide use.

In the short term, thiacloprid exposure increased responses to the floral VOCs benzyl-alcohol and 1-hexanol, which are also found in honeybee sting gland secretions. Responses to QMP and alarm pheromone 2-heptanone were also affected. The response signal to the positive control citral also degenerated more quickly in thiacloprid exposed bees over the short term. The only long-term effect of pesticide exposure was a decrease in responsiveness to methyl salicylate in Thiacloprid exposed bees. Imidacloprid exposure induced no effects on antennal responses. The study also obserbed season-related differences in antennal responses to several VOCs and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone.

It also addresses the alarming decline in bee populations and the detrimental effects of neonicotinoid insecticides, highlighting the need for awareness and protective measures in the field.",
    "answer_rev1": "Foraging activity of the bees did not appear to be impacted when neonicotinoids were applied as seed treatment neonicotinoid insecticides were present below the limits of quantification in pollen and nectar.Contrarily, foliar application of the neonicotinoides significantly reduced the foraging activity between 1 and 3 days after application and neonicotinoids were detected in leaf, pollen and nectar samples. 7 days after spraying, foraging activities went back to values comparable to control.",
    "answer_rev2": "The study found that when applied as a seed treatment, levels of pesticide residues in pollen and nectar samples were below quantifiable levels, whereas levels in foliar spray treated plants were higher. In line with this, they observed no effect of the seed treatment on honeybee foraging behaviour, whereas foliar sprays reduced foraging for 1-3 days post-application, but that this returned to normal levels after 7 days. Therefore the authors conclude that there is little short-term impact of neonicotinoid application on bee foraging activity, especially when applied as a seed treatment. The authors recommend that sprays should not be used during flowering stages.",

Some of the pesticides tested- sulfoxaflor, deltamethrin and esfenvalerate were found to be more toxic than one of the neonicotinoids banned for outdoor use in the EU, which the authors conclude is concerning since these are likely to replace the banned pesticides and may have an impact on bee populations.",

They found that the results with microcolonies contradicted the results with queenright colonies, and that different effects were found during short vs. long term experiments highlighting the need for long term experimnets in risk assessments and the potential for underestimating risk when using microcolonies. The effects of thiacloprid on the fitness of queenright colonies was also confirmed by the field experiment, and the negative effects of acetamiprid were only apparent under field conditions.

The findings indicate that imidacloprid generally has delayed toxic effects, and its toxicity can increase over time. The authors recommend extending the observation period up to 10 days to detect potential negative effects of imidacloprid and suggest that compounds with delayed toxicity should be avoided due to the difficulties in assessing their negative impacts on pollinators.",
