Conduct systematic testing of pyrethroids on cloned and expressed Apis mellifera calcium channels (AmCa<sub>v</sub>) to understand their impact on honeybee physiology.\n3. Explore the potential effects of pyrethroids on secondary targets such as voltage-gated calcium channels, which may affect locomotion, thermoregulation, and hemolymph circulation in honeybees.\n4. Develop a model to link different modes of pesticide exposure (e.g., contact with contaminated waxes vs. laboratory procedures) for accurate risk evaluation.\n5. Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the insecticide-specific effects on bee locomotion and mortality.\n6. Conduct longer recording durations to reveal subtle alterations in inter-individual interactions, grooming behaviors, and time spent near a food source.\n7. Implement more sophisticated homing-flight experiments or more subtle memory or orientation tests to further understand the effects of insecticides on bees.\n8. Explore alternative methods of pest control due to the high toxicity of neonicotinoids towards honeybees, especially in light of their temporary ban in Europe.",
