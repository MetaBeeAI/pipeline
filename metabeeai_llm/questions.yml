Domain: population"
      - "Locomotion: individual bees were assessed for locomotory performance following acute exposure, with 20 bees per treatment group. Domain is individual; Colony survival: colony survival was assessed by counting the number of dead bees in each colony after 7 days. Domain is population"
    bad_example_output:
