    "experimental_methodology": {
      "answer": "1. **Colony Assessment (field):**\n   - **Study Design:** Randomized field experiment with tripols (multi-hives) assigned randomly to treatment and location.\n   - **Sample Size:** 9 colonies per site (3 tripols) and 1 additional single hive for pollen collection, totaling 10 hives per location.\n   - **Variables Measured:** Colony health, queen presence, worker homogeneity, and pollen collection.\n\n2. **Colony Composition (field):**\n   - **Study Design:** Observational study with controlled colony composition.\n   - **Sample Size:** Each hive consisted of a mother queen and 40 to 50 workers of the same age.\n   - **Variables Measured:** Worker age homogeneity, queen health, and colony temperature maintenance.\n\n3. **Colony Weight and Worker Estimation (field):**\n   - **Study Design:** Observational study conducted during the exposure phase.\n   - **Sample Size:** Not specified.\n   - **Variables Measured:** Hive weight, estimated number of workers, flight activity, guarding and cooling behavior.\n\n4. **Pollen Collection and Analysis (field):**\n   - **Study Design:** Field survey conducted at two different time points during OSR flowering.\n   - **Sample Size:** Approximately 20 returning foragers with pollen loads collected during the first sampling event and approximately 40 during the second.\n   - **Variables Measured:** Pollen composition from returning bumble bee workers.\n\n5. **Reproductive Success (field experiment):**\n   - **Study Design:** Field experiment with colonies placed at different distances from a reference and test site.\n   - **Sample Size:** 54 colonies per treatment, with specific counts of 37 colonies at the reference site and 41 at the test site.\n   - **Variables Measured:** Number of young queens, queen brood cells, and reproductive success (sum of young queens and queen brood cells).",

    "significance": {
      "answer": "- No adverse effect of clothianidin-treated OSR on bumble bee colony development was observed, as measured by hive weight.\n- No effect on the number of worker bumble bees was detected.\n- No effect on the numbers of young queens and queen brood cells, considered the most biologically meaningful endpoint, was observed.\n- Residue analysis confirmed exposure to clothianidin in test site colonies, with measured levels ranging from 1.0 to 1.3 \u00b5g/kg in three locations.\n- Bumble bees were observed foraging on crops treated with clothianidin, indicating direct exposure to this pesticide.",
      "reason": "The study focused on the effects of clothianidin-treated oilseed rape (OSR) on bumble bee colonies, specifically examining colony development and reproduction metrics.",
