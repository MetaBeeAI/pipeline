This has led to bans on neonicotinoid use in the EU and has resulted in repeated calls for the agrochemical regulatory process to be modified. For example, there is increasing concern about 1) the underrepresentation of wild bees, such as bumblebees, in the regulatory process, and 2) the failure to determine how agrochemicals, such as neonicotinoids, interact with other commonly occurring environmental stressors, such as parasites. Here, we modify an OECD approved lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) experimental design and expose bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and the highly prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi, in a fully crossed design. We found no difference in the LD<sub>50</sub> of thiamethoxam on bumblebees that had or had not been inoculated with the parasite (Crithidia bombi). Furthermore, thiamethoxam dosage did not appear to influence the peak intensity of surviving bumblebees, and there was no effect of either parasite or insecticide on sucrose consumption. The methodology used demonstrates how existing ring-tested experimental designs can be effectively modified to include other environmental stressors such as parasites. Moving forward, the regulatory process should implement methodologies that assess the interactions between agrochemicals and parasites on non-Apis bees and, in cases when this is not practical, should implement post-regulatory monitoring to better understand the real-world consequences of agrochemical use.\n\n**Key words**: neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, Crithidia bombi, Bombus, toxicity test",

        "text": "## Neonicotinoids and Their Impact\n\nNeonicotinoids are systemic insecticides that are effective at controlling a broad range of pest species such as aphids, whiteflies, and pollen beetles (Simon-Delso et al. 2015). As neurotoxins, they target the insect nervous system, acting as agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Moffat et al. 2016). Neonicotinoids can be used as a seed treatment or foliar spray but are highly persistent in the environment, and may persist in soil for over a year (Goulson 2013, Bass et al. 2015, Bonmatin et al. 2015). Neonicotinoids can therefore contaminate the nectar and pollen of treated crops as well as neighbouring wildflowers, leading to exposure for bees and other flower visiting insects (Stewart et al. 2014, Botias et al. 2016).\n\nAn analysis of global honey samples revealed that 75% of honey contained at least one neonicotinoid insecticide, with 45% containing two, confirming that bees are routinely exposed to neonicotinoids on a global scale (Mitchell et al. 2017). Such exposure can have significant negative effects on bee colony health, behaviour, and physiology (reviewed by Godfray et al. 2014, Goulson et al. 2015, Pisa et al. 2017, Maini et al. 2018, Siviter et al. 2018b) which has led to bans and restrictions on their use globally, most notably in the European Union, where 3 commonly used neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin) are now banned. However, neonicotinoid use remains common globally, particularly in the United States and China (Simon-Delso et al. 2015).",

        "text": "Bumblebees are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wildflowers (Willmer et al. 1994, Garibaldi et al. 2013). Bumblebee nests routinely contain a plethora of different parasites and pesticides, suggesting that simultaneous exposure to both parasites and agrochemicals is the norm, not the exception (Goulson et al. 2018, Nicholls et al. 2018). When bees are exposed to multiple stressors, the stressors can interact and become more detrimental than when exposed to a stressor in isolation (Doublet et al. 2015, Tosi and Nieh 2019, Linguaodoca et al. 2021). For example, Di Prisco et al. (2013) found that honeybees (A. mellifera) exposed to the neonicotinoid clothianidin had a reduced immune defence, which promoted the replication of DWV. Furthermore, coexposure to neonicotinoids and parasites can also increase the likelihood of adult, or larval mortality (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014, Doublet et al. 2015). Therefore, understanding how, and to what degree, insecticides and parasites interact when bees are simultaneously exposed to both is of utmost importance.",

Previous studies investigating the interactions between thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* have shown various interaction effects (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014, Fauser et al. 2017, Baron et al. 2017) and simultaneous exposure to both stressors can lower bumblebee survival (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014). This suggests that toxicity assessment of thiamethoxam conducted in the regulatory process could underestimate the potential real-world consequences of thiamethoxam exposure on bumblebees infected with common bumblebee parasites.",

        "text": "## Agrochemical Regulatory Processes\n\nAgrochemical regulatory processes differ between nations and governing bodies. The European Union, which is considered to have the most rigorous regulatory process, has a tiered system that is heavily reliant on toxicity tests in the lower tiers to determine whether agrochemicals (pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides) are hazardous to animals (EFSA 2013, OECD 2017, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). When determining whether an agrochemical is \u2018bee safe\u2019 or not, toxicity tests, such as LD\u2085\u2080 and LC\u2085\u2080 tests, will be conducted on honeybees (Tier 1) to determine the amount of active ingredient that is required to kill 50% of the population when bees are orally (LD\u2085\u2080) or topically (LC\u2085\u2080) exposed. Based on this information, further higher tier assessments will, or will not, be conducted (EFSA 2013, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). In its current form bumblebee LD\u2085\u2080 experiments can be conducted in Tier 1 of the regulatory process, but this is not mandated, and the potential interactions between insecticides and other environmental stressors are not considered (EFSA 2013, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). Regulators and policy makers therefore require methodologies that can be used within the current regulatory framework that test the impact of agrochemicals on non-Apis-bees and 2) test how agrochemicals interact with other environmental factors (EFSA 2013, Vanbergen & Insect Pollinators Initiative 2013, Franklin and Raine 2019, Siviter et al. 2021a, c).",

        "text": "## Bumblebees and Agrochemicals\n\nBumblebees are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wildflowers (Willmer et al. 1994, Garibaldi et al. 2013). Bumblebee nests routinely contain a plethora of different parasites and pesticides, suggesting that simultaneous exposure to both parasites and agrochemicals is the norm, not the exception (Goulson et al. 2018, Nicholls et al. 2018). When bees are exposed to multiple stressors, the stressors can interact and become more detrimental than when exposed to a stressor in isolation (Doublet et al. 2015, Tosi and Nieh 2019, Linguaodoca et al. 2021). For example, Di Prisco et al. (2013) found that honeybees (A. mellifera) exposed to the neonicotinoid clothianidin had a reduced immune defence, which promoted the replication of DWV. Furthermore, coexposure to neonicotinoids and parasites can also increase the likelihood of adult, or larval mortality (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014, Doublet et al. 2015). Therefore, understanding how, and to what degree, insecticides and parasites interact when bees are simultaneously exposed to both is of utmost importance.\n\n## Thiamethoxam and C. bombi\n\nThiamethoxam is one of the most commonly used neonicotinoids in the world, and is routinely found in the nectar and pollen collected by bumblebees (Botias et al. 2017, Nicholls et al. 2018). Crithidia bombi is a trypanosome parasite that is highly prevalent in bumblebee populations, with infection levels ranging from 0 to 80%, depending upon the population and time of year (Shykoff and Schmid-Hempel 1991, Gillespie 2010, Kissinger et al. 2011, Jones and Brown 2014). C. bombi exposure when combined with stressors like nutrient limitation or hibernation can significantly reduce bumblebee survival (Brown et al. 2000), colony founding, growth and reproductive output (Brown et al. 2003, Yourth et al. 2008), and can also impair foraging behaviour and learning (Gegear et al. 2005, 2006; Otterstatter et al. 2005) but see (Martin et al. 2018). Previous studies investigating the interactions between thiamethoxam and C. bombi have shown various interaction effects and simultaneous exposure to both stressors can lower bumblebee survival (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014, Fauser et al. 2017, Baron et al. 2017) and simultaneous exposure to both stressors can lower bumblebee queen survival (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014). This suggests that toxicity assessment of thiamethoxam conducted in the regulatory process could underestimate the potential real-world consequences of thiamethoxam exposure on bumblebees infected with common bumblebee parasites.\n\n## Agrochemical Regulatory Processes\n\nAgrochemical regulatory processes differ between nations and governing bodies. The European Union, which is considered to have the most rigorous regulatory process, has a tiered system that is heavily reliant on toxicity tests in the lower tiers to determine whether agrochemicals (pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides) are hazardous to animals (EFSA 2013, OECD 2017, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). When determining whether an agrochemical is \u2018bee safe\u2019 or not, toxicity tests, such as LD50 and LC50 tests will be conducted on honeybees (Tier 1) to determine the amount of active ingredient that is required to kill 50% of the population when bees are orally (LD50) or topically (LC50) exposed. Based on this information, further higher tier assessments will, or will not, be conducted (EFSA 2013, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). In its current form bumblebee LD50 experiments can be conducted in Tier 1 of the regulatory process, but this is not mandated, and the potential interactions between insecticides and other environmental stressors are not considered (EFSA 2013, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). Regulators and policy makers therefore require methodologies that can be used within the current regulatory framework that assess the impact of agrochemicals on non-Apis-bees and 2) test how agrochemicals interact with other environmental factors (EFSA 2013, Vanbergen & Insect Pollinators Initiative 2013, Franklin and Raine 2019; Siviter et al. 2021a, c).",

Models were selected based on Akaike weights derived from AIC\\textsubscript{c} values, and were included when they could not be rejected with a 95% certainty (this included cases in which the null model was accepted within the confidence set). When more than one model was present within the confidence set, model averaging was used [Burnham and Anderson 2002].\n\nFollowing Ritz et al. (2015) we used a fitted dose-response model (`drc`) based on a log-logistic regression analysis to determine the LD\\textsubscript{50} values for bumblebees that were and were not inoculated with *C. bombi*. A mixed effect Cox model and a linear mixed effect model were used to determine if *C. bombi* influenced bumblebee mortality and sucrose consumption respectively. *C. bombi*, thiamethoxam dosage, and their interaction were included as fixed factors and bee size was included as a covariate. Colony of origin was included as a random factor. Parasite count was logged (log\\textsubscript{10}) to improve model fit and analysed using a linear mixed effect model with thiamethoxam dosages, with bee size included as a covariant, and colony of origin included as a random factor.\n\nWe used the packages `drc`, `MuMIn`, `lme4` & `coxme` [Bates et al. 2015, Ritz et al. 2015, Barton 2016, Therneau 2018].",

        "text": "## Discussion\n\nPrevious studies with bumblebees have shown that the LD\\(_{50}\\) of thiamethoxam is 5 ng of active ingredient per bumblebee [EFSA 2015] and our results were similar (6.63 ng when exposed to thiamethoxam in isolation and 6.82 ng for bumblebees exposed to both thiamethoxam and *C. bombi*). This suggests that contrary to our original hypothesis, the parasite *C. bombi* had no impact on the LD\\(_{50}\\) of thiamethoxam on bumblebees (*B. terrestris*). This is surprising, as the effects of this parasite on bumblebees are context-dependent, and emerge most obviously when bees are exposed to other stressors [Brown et al. 2000, 2003; Yourth et al. 2008]. Interestingly, and in contrast to previously observed results [Kessler et al. 2015, Arce et al. 2018] (but see [Muth et al. 2020]), we found no effect of thiamethoxam exposure on sucrose consumption. Finally, thiamethoxam exposure was seen to increase *C. bombi* intensity, but only at lethal dosages as there was no effect at sub-lethal levels. Our results demonstrate that methodologies currently used within the regulatory process can be modified to consider the interaction effects between multiple environmental stressors on wild bees.\n\nWe found no evidence of interaction effects between thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* on bumblebee mortality. This contrasts with previous studies that have shown that simultaneous exposure to both thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* can reduce bumblebee survival [Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014]. However, Fauser-Misslin et al. (2014) assessed the impact of chronic, sub-lethal thiamethoxam concentrations over 9 wk on queen bumblebee survival, while here we used acute dosages, in a toxicity test with workers. Toxicity tests such as LD\\(_{50}\\) experiments, are important in determining the lethal consequences of agrochemical use, but are not designed to detect more subtle, sub-lethal impacts of agrochemical exposure [Gill et al. 2012, Siviter et al. 2020b, Siviter et al. 2021b]. While our modified LD\\(_{50}\\) protocol can be used to assess how parasites and agrochemicals interact at higher dosages, a failure to conduct sub-lethal assessments of chronic exposure in bumblebees alongside toxicity tests will clearly result in a failure to detect sub-lethal, but significant, effects.",

        "text": "## Discussion\n\nPrevious studies with bumblebees have shown that the LD\\(_{50}\\) of thiamethoxam is 5 ng of active ingredient per bumblebee [EFSA 2015] and our results were similar (6.63 ng when exposed to thiamethoxam in isolation and 6.82 ng for bumblebees exposed to both thiamethoxam and *C. bombi*). This suggests that contrary to our original hypothesis, the parasite *C. bombi* had no impact on the LD\\(_{50}\\) of thiamethoxam on bumblebees (*B. terrestris*). This is surprising, as the effects of this parasite on bumblebees are context-dependent, and emerge most obviously when bees are exposed to other stressors [Brown et al. 2000, 2003; Yourth et al. 2008]. Interestingly, and in contrast to previously observed results [Kessler et al. 2015, Arce et al. 2018] (but see [Muth et al. 2020]), we found no effect of thiamethoxam exposure on sucrose consumption. Finally, thiamethoxam exposure was seen to increase *C. bombi* intensity, but only at lethal dosages as there was no effect at sub-lethal levels. Our results demonstrate that methodologies currently used within the regulatory process can be modified to consider the interaction effects between multiple environmental stressors on wild bees.\n\nWe found no evidence of interaction effects between thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* on bumblebee mortality. This contrasts with previous studies that have shown that simultaneous exposure to both thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* can reduce bumblebee survival [Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014]. However, Fauser-Misslin et al. (2014) assessed the impact of chronic, sub-lethal thiamethoxam concentrations over 9 wk on queen bumblebee survival, while here we used acute dosages, in a toxicity test with workers. Toxicity tests, such as LD\\(_{50}\\) experiments, are important in determining the lethal consequences of agrochemical use, but are not designed to detect more subtle, sub-lethal impacts of agrochemical exposure [Gill et al. 2012, Siviter et al. 2020b, Siviter et al. 2021b]. While our modified LD\\(_{50}\\) protocol can be used to assess how parasites and agrochemicals interact at higher dosages, a failure to conduct sub-lethal assessments of chronic exposure in bumblebees alongside toxicity tests will clearly result in a failure to detect sub-lethal, but significant, effects.",

        "text": "## Text from Document\n\nWe found that *C. bombi* intensity was significantly higher in bumblebees that had been fed high dosages of thiamethoxam and that had subsequently died. *C. bombi* intensity typically increases for up to 7 days after inoculation and plateaus between 7- and 10-days post inoculation (Logan et al. 2005). We exposed bumblebees to thiamethoxam 7 days post inoculation and found that bees that died (on day 7) had a higher intensity of *C. bombi* than bees that survived (Fig. 4). One explanation for this is that acute exposure to thiamethoxam exerts long-term inhibition on the growth of *C. bombi*, and that this could only occur in bees that survived exposure. Alternatively, higher *C. bombi* counts in bumblebees exposed to lethal acute doses could be due to rapidly enhanced production or release of the parasite from the gut lining (Koch et al. 2019). Future experiments are needed to determine the mechanism behind this interaction. However, as we found no effect of sub-lethal thiamethoxam dosages on *C. bombi* intensity, this suggests that at field-realistic levels, thiamethoxam is unlikely to impact *C. bombi* intensity.\n\nNeonicotinoids are the most commonly used insecticides in the world and understanding the interaction between them and bumblebee pathogens is therefore vitally important. However, as the number of insect pests that are resistant to neonicotinoids increases and bans/restrictions on their use increase globally, novel insecticides such as sulfoxaflor or flupyradifurone could replace them over large geographical areas (Brown et al. 2016, Siviter and Muth 2020). Sulfoxaflor exposure can have significant sub-lethal impacts on bumblebee (*B. terrestris*) reproduction (Siviter et al. 2018a, Siviter et al. 2020 a,b; Linguaodoca et al. 2021) (but see [Siviter et al. 2019]) and flupyradifurone exposure can impair honeybee larval development (Tan et al. 2017, Al Naggar and Baer 2019), and adult behavior (Tosi and Nieh 2019, Tong et al. 2019, Hesselbach et al. 2020) (recently reviewed in [Siviter and Muth 2020]). Novel insecticides could also interact with bee pathogens, for example, bumblebee larvae fed sulfoxaflor in isolation showed no evidence of an increase in larval mortality, but when exposed to sulfoxaflor, and the common bumblebee parasite *Nosema bombi*, there was a significant increase in larval mortality (Siviter et al. 2020a). Similarly, honeybees (*A. mellifera*) fed flupyradifurone and inoculated with *N. ceranae* had lower survival than unexposed bees, and those exposed to each stressor in isolation (Al Naggar and Baer 2019). While we found no interaction between *C. bombi* and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on bee mortality, future research should focus on understanding how novel insecticides, such as sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone, interact with common bee parasites (Siviter and Muth 2020).\n\nGlobal bee declines are thought to be driven by multiple anthropogenic stressors, including agrochemicals and parasites (Vanbergen & Insect Pollinators Initiative 2013, Goulson et al. 2015, Siviter et al. 2021a) which suggests that the agrochemical regulatory process should consider how insecticides interact with commonly occurring bee parasites (Siviter and Muth 2020). Here we show how toxicity tests, such as LD50 experiments, can be modified to consider the interactions between agrochemicals and parasites. This methodology could easily be modified to test other parasites depending on the life history of the parasites. However, the sheer number of bee parasites (known and unknown), and the range of different agrochemicals used in intensive agriculture means that testing every potential interaction between parasites and agrochemicals is impractical, and in some cases, when we do not have an understanding of the parasite life-history, impossible. In these cases, post-authorisation monitoring observations, which are currently nonexistent (Milner and Boyd 2017), should be...",
