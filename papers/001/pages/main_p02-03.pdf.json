Bumblebee nests routinely contain a plethora of different parasites and pesticides, suggesting that simultaneous exposure to both parasites and agrochemicals is the norm, not the exception (Goulson et al. 2018, Nicholls et al. 2018). When bees are exposed to multiple stressors, the stressors can interact and become more detrimental than when exposed to a stressor in isolation (Doublet et al. 2015, Tosi and Nieh 2019, Linguaodoca et al. 2021). For example, Di Prisco et al. (2013) found that honeybees (A. mellifera) exposed to the neonicotinoid clothianidin had a reduced immune defence, which promoted the replication of DWV. Furthermore, coexposure to neonicotinoids and parasites can also increase the likelihood of adult, or larval mortality (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014, Doublet et al. 2015). Therefore, understanding how, and to what degree, insecticides and parasites interact when bees are simultaneously exposed to both is of utmost importance.\n\n## Thiamethoxam and C. bombi\n\nThiamethoxam is one of the most commonly used neonicotinoids in the world, and is routinely found in the nectar and pollen collected by bumblebees (Botias et al. 2017, Nicholls et al. 2018). Crithidia bombi is a trypanosome parasite that is highly prevalent in bumblebee populations, with infection levels ranging from 0 to 80%, depending upon the population and time of year (Shykoff and Schmid-Hempel 1991, Gillespie 2010, Kissinger et al. 2011, Jones and Brown 2014). C. bombi exposure when combined with stressors like nutrient limitation or hibernation can significantly reduce bumblebee survival (Brown et al. 2000), colony founding, growth and reproductive output (Brown et al. 2003, Yourth et al. 2008), and can also impair foraging behaviour and learning (Gegear et al. 2005, 2006; Otterstatter et al. 2005) but see (Martin et al. 2018). Previous studies investigating the interactions between thiamethoxam and C. bombi have shown various interaction effects and simultaneous exposure to both stressors can lower bumblebee survival (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014, Fauser et al. 2017, Baron et al. 2017) and simultaneous exposure to both stressors can lower bumblebee queen survival (Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014). This suggests that toxicity assessment of thiamethoxam conducted in the regulatory process could underestimate the potential real-world consequences of thiamethoxam exposure on bumblebees infected with common bumblebee parasites.\n\n## Agrochemical Regulatory Processes\n\nAgrochemical regulatory processes differ between nations and governing bodies. The European Union, which is considered to have the most rigorous regulatory process, has a tiered system that is heavily reliant on toxicity tests in the lower tiers to determine whether agrochemicals (pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides) are hazardous to animals (EFSA 2013, OECD 2017, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). When determining whether an agrochemical is ‘bee safe’ or not, toxicity tests, such as LD50 and LC50 tests will be conducted on honeybees (Tier 1) to determine the amount of active ingredient that is required to kill 50% of the population when bees are orally (LD50) or topically (LC50) exposed. Based on this information, further higher tier assessments will, or will not, be conducted (EFSA 2013, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). In its current form bumblebee LD50 experiments can be conducted in Tier 1 of the regulatory process, but this is not mandated, and the potential interactions between insecticides and other environmental stressors are not considered (EFSA 2013, Sanchez-Bayo and Tennekes 2017). Regulators and policy makers therefore require methodologies that can be used within the current regulatory framework that assess the impact of agrochemicals on non-Apis-bees and 2) test how agrochemicals interact with other environmental factors (EFSA 2013, Vanbergen & Insect Pollinators Initiative 2013, Franklin and Raine 2019; Siviter et al. 2021a, c). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.068,r=0.485,b=0.304); page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.308,r=0.485,b=0.613); page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.616,r=0.486,b=0.935), with ID 2f9ec352-fd32-4720-81ce-4da3d4fe31dc -->\n\nHere we ask if simultaneous exposure to both thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* changes the LD\\(_{50}\\) values of thiamethoxam in bumblebees (*Bombus terrestris*).

The faeces of 15 workers from each colony were examined using a phase contrast microscope for common bumblebee parasites (*Apicystis bombi, Crithidia spp. & Nosema spp.*, 400× magnification) ([Rutrecht and Brown 2009](#)). All colonies were unparasitized. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.514,t=0.238,r=0.909,b=0.382), with ID a2fd9191-5c69-401b-960d-8e3d77d541a2 -->\n\n## Parasite Inoculation\n\nThe aim of this experiment was to determine if inoculation with the parasite *C. bombi* changed the LD\\(_{50}\\) of thiamethoxam on bumblebees. To achieve this, we had a total of 21 treatment groups (2 control groups, 1 *C. bombi* group, 9 thiamethoxam groups and 9 groups exposed to both thiamethoxam & *C. bombi*; see Supp Table S1 [online only]). We had 40 bumblebees in each treatment group and all bees were individually housed in Nicot cages (see below for details). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.514,t=0.403,r=0.909,b=0.515), with ID 644ddff3-6f60-48d8-b2d7-2d172876d63e -->\n\nTo create a *C. bombi* inoculum the faeces of 30 workers were taken from a commercial colony infected with multiple strains of *C. bombi*. These strains were originally isolated from bumblebee queens caught at Windsor Great Park (United Kingdom) and then propagated through commercial colonies in the laboratory. Faeces of infected workers from these colonies were placed in an Eppendorf tube containing 0.9% Ringer solution and centrifuged at 0.8 g for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and clean Ringer solution added, a process that was repeated 7 times (8 times in total) to purify and concentrate the preinoculum (following a modified triangulation protocol based on (Cole 1970)). Cell counts were carried out using a Neubauer improved haemocytometer to determine the concentration of *C. bombi* cells. The *C. bombi* preinoculum was then combined with sucrose (50°Brix) to create an inoculum of 1,000 cells/μl. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.515,t=0.519,r=0.909,b=0.724), with ID 657bbd70-ba8b-4930-9fc6-178d8e80ff9f -->\n\nIndividual bumblebees from all treatment groups (see Supp Table S1 [online only] for list of treatment groups) were taken from queen-right colonies, and individually housed in Nicot cages (148 × 130 × 11 mm) with ad libitum access to 50°Brix sucrose through a 1 ml syringe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.515,t=0.728,r=0.909,b=0.796), with ID 3df267b8-0bc8-427a-b744-ff639b6472a3 -->\n\n## Text\n\nPrior to inoculation, workers from all the treatment groups underwent a starvation period of 3 h [Logan et al. 2005] after which all bees were removed from their Nicot cages and placed in an individual vial (9 × 2.5 cm). The inoculum was presented to each individual to drink with a 10 μl droplet of 50°Brix sucrose solution containing approximately 10,000 C. bombi. A dose of 10,000 cells has been determined to produce a reliable and high rate of infection [Ruiz-Gonzalez and Brown 2006]. A period of 15 min was allowed for the individual to consume the inoculum.

The acute oral LD50 for thiamethoxam in *B. terrestris* has previously been determined to be 5 ng/g of active substance/bee (EFSA 2015) and we based our dosages on this (see Supp Table S1 [online only]).\n\nPrior to being fed the relative thiamethoxam dose the sucrose syringes were removed from the Nicot cages and the bees starved for 3 h. Following this, the syringes were replaced with new ones with a 40 µl sucrose solution (50°Brix) containing the relevant thiamethoxam dosage. Bees were left for 4 h, after which the syringes were replaced with weighted syringes containing clean sucrose. Bees that had not consumed the entire dosages were removed from the experiment (n = 8, see Supp Table S1 [online only]).\n\nBees were left for 96 h and mortality was recorded at 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, after being fed the thiamethoxam inoculation (OECD 2017). All bees that died during the experiment were frozen at −80°C. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.089,t=0.197,r=0.484,b=0.475), with ID 667ae264-5038-47fc-9a1e-40585681aae3 -->\n\n## Parasite Analysis\n\nAll bees were screened for *C. bombi* infection. Individual bees were dissected, and the hindgut was removed and placed into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. 100 μl of 0.9% Ringer’s solution was added and the hindgut was pulverised within the Ringer solution. The contents were then vortexed for 2 s. Uninoculated bees were checked for infection by placing 14 μl from each sample onto a microscope slide and analysing it for *C. bombi* cells under phase contrast at 400x magnification. No uninoculated bees were found to be infected.\n\nFor inoculated bees, we used a Neubauer improved haemocytometer to measure *C. bombi* intensity, and to count the number of *C. bombi* cells per μl. Inoculated bees that had no sign of an infection were removed from the analyses (n = 4).\n\nThorax width, as a proxy for body size, was measured using a Mitutoyo digital calliper, with all individuals measured three times to produce a mean measure of size. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.090,t=0.495,r=0.484,b=0.720), with ID 931483a3-f01f-4802-9149-db1a4c1093f4 -->\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nWe used an information theoretic model selection approach for each test (except for determining the LD\\(_{50}\\) values [see below]). The initial model set contained all measured factors and was compared to all subsets of the full model, and a null model containing just the intercept and random factors. Models were selected based on Akaike weights derived from AIC\\(_c\\) values, and were included when they could not be rejected with a 95% certainty (this included cases in which the null model was accepted within the confidence set). When more than one model was present within the confidence set, model averaging was used (Burnham and Anderson 2002). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.089,t=0.739,r=0.484,b=0.892), with ID 2d36cda9-8164-4572-86bd-20c232589a42 -->\n\n## Text from Document\n\nA mixed effect Cox model and a linear mixed effect model were used to determine if *C. bombi* influenced bumblebee mortality and sucrose consumption respectively. *C. bombi*, thiamethoxam dosage, and their interaction were included as fixed factors and bee size was included as a covariate. Colony of origin was included as a random factor. Parasite count was logged (log10) to improve model fit and analysed using a linear mixed effect model with thiamethoxam dosages, with bee size included as a covariant, and colony of origin included as a random factor.\n\nWe used the packages *lme4*, *MuMIn*, *lmerTest* & *coxme* (Bates et al. 2015, Ritz et al. 2015, Barton 2016, Therneau 2018). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.513,t=0.068,r=0.906,b=0.192); page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.195,r=0.907,b=0.220), with ID 00b3735a-e560-4f3f-a6c2-8070d3c0feeb -->\n\n## Results\n\nWe found that the LD<sub>50</sub> value for thiamethoxam was 6.63 ng when used in isolation compared with 6.82 ng per bumblebee when used in combination with the parasite *C. bombi*, suggesting no observed differences in mortality between infected and uninfected bumblebees (Fig. 1A and B, Coxme, *C. bombi*, Parameter Estimate (ES) = 0.10, Confidence Interval (CI) = -0.11 to 0.33). Bumblebee size had an effect on mortality, but the effect was not linear, with mortality risk increasing for both smaller and larger bees (Fig. 2, Coxme, size, PE = -0.35, CI = -0.60 to -0.11).\n\nWe found no effect of thiamethoxam or *C. bombi* inoculation on sucrose consumption (Fig. 3, Supp Table S2 and S3 [online only]). Interestingly, as thiamethoxam dose increased, this resulted in bumblebees having a higher intensity of *C. bombi* infection (Fig. 4A, lmer, dosage, PE = 0.0047, CI = 0.003-0.006). However, when subjects that died during the experiment were excluded from the analysis there was no effect of thiamethoxam dose on parasite intensity (Fig. 4B, lmer, dosage, PE = 0.001, CI = -0.01 to 0.013), suggesting no effect of thiamethoxam on *C. bombi* intensity at sub-lethal levels. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.513,t=0.246,r=0.907,b=0.515), with ID 253d5e1f-1b4a-40a9-91aa-93ea74dab617 -->\n\n### Figure Description\n\nThe figure consists of two dose-dependent plots demonstrating the LD\\(_{50}\\) values for bees exposed to thiamethoxam, both in isolation and when inoculated with *Crithidia bombi*.\n\n#### Plot A: Thiamethoxam\n\n- **Title**: Thiamethoxam\n- **X-axis**: Dosage (ng/bee), ranging from 0 to 100.\n- **Y-axis**: Proportion of mortalities, ranging from 0 to 1.0.\n- **Curve**: A sigmoidal curve showing the relationship between dosage and mortality.\n- **LD\\(_{50}\\) Annotation**: \n  - Marked with a red dashed line at approximately 6.63 ng.\n  - The LD\\(_{50}\\) value is indicated as 6.63 ng.\n\n#### Plot B: Thiamethoxam & *Crithidia bombi*\n\n- **Title**: Thiamethoxam & *Crithidia bombi*\n- **X-axis**: Dosage (ng/bee), ranging from 0 to 100.\n- **Y-axis**: Proportion of mortalities, ranging from 0 to 1.0.\n- **Curve**: A sigmoidal curve similar to Plot A, showing the relationship between dosage and mortality.\n- **LD\\(_{50}\\) Annotation**: \n  - Marked with a red dashed line at approximately 6.82 ng.\n  - The LD\\(_{50}\\) value is indicated as 6.82 ng.\n\n### Figure Caption\n\n**Fig. 1.** Dose-dependent plots demonstrating the LD\\(_{50}\\) values for bees exposed to thiamethoxam in isolation (A) and bees inoculated with *C. bombi* and exposed to varying dosage of thiamethoxam (B).
