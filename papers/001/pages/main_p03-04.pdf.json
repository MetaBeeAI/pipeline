All workers were then placed back into their allotted Nicot cages and the sucrose syringe was returned. To enable the parasite to establish itself within the host the bees (both parasitized and unparasitized) were then left for 7 d (Schmid-Hempel and Schmid-Hempel 1993, Logan et al. 2005). 76 bumblebees died during this time period, but there was no difference in mortality between inoculated and uninoculated bees (see Supp Table S1 [online only]). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.069,r=0.484,b=0.179), with ID 849976a9-da54-4886-8af9-bd599f0d2f18 -->\n\n### Thiamethoxam Exposure\n\nThiamethoxam PESTANAL analytical standard (100 µg) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and combined with 100 ml of acetone solution to produce the stock solution, which was subsequently combined with sucrose (50°Brix) to create the required dosages. The acute oral LD50 for thiamethoxam in *B. terrestris* has previously been determined to be 5 ng/g of active substance/bee (EFSA 2015) and we based our dosages on this (see Supp Table S1 [online only]).\n\nPrior to being fed the relative thiamethoxam dose the sucrose syringes were removed from the Nicot cages and the bees starved for 3 h. Following this, the syringes were replaced with new ones with a 40 µl sucrose solution (50°Brix) containing the relevant thiamethoxam dosage. Bees were left for 4 h, after which the syringes were replaced with weighted syringes containing clean sucrose. Bees that had not consumed the entire dosages were removed from the experiment (n = 8, see Supp Table S1 [online only]).\n\nBees were left for 96 h and mortality was recorded at 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, after being fed the thiamethoxam inoculation (OECD 2017). All bees that died during the experiment were frozen at −80°C. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.197,r=0.484,b=0.475), with ID 69485f7b-d649-40de-85cc-62ac63fec899 -->\n\n## Parasite Analysis\n\nAll bees were screened for *C. bombi* infection. Individual bees were dissected, and the hindgut was removed and placed into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. 100 μl of 0.9% Ringer’s solution was added and the hindgut was pulverised within the Ringer solution. The contents were then vortexed for 2 s. Uninoculated bees were checked for infection by placing 14 μl from each sample onto a microscope slide and analysing it for *C. bombi* cells under phase contrast at 400× magnification. No uninoculated bees were found to be infected.\n\nFor inoculated bees, we used a Neubauer improved haemocytometer to measure *C. bombi* intensity, and to count the number of *C. bombi* cells per μl. Inoculated bees that had no sign of an infection were removed from the analyses (n = 4).\n\nThorax width, as a proxy for body size, was measured using a Mitutoyo digital calliper, with all individuals measured three times to produce a mean measure of size. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.495,r=0.484,b=0.720), with ID 5e9f5325-a242-4134-be97-ea134d891cd3 -->\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nWe used an information theoretic model selection approach for each test (except for determining the LD\\textsubscript{50} values [see below]). The initial model set contained all measured factors and was compared to all subsets of the full model, and a null model containing just the intercept and random factors. Models were selected based on Akaike weights derived from AIC\\textsubscript{c} values, and were included when they could not be rejected with a 95% certainty (this included cases in which the null model was accepted within the confidence set). When more than one model was present within the confidence set, model averaging was used [Burnham and Anderson 2002].\n\nFollowing Ritz et al. (2015) we used a fitted dose-response model (`drc`) based on a log-logistic regression analysis to determine the LD\\textsubscript{50} values for bumblebees that were and were not inoculated with *C. bombi*. A mixed effect Cox model and a linear mixed effect model were used to determine if *C. bombi* influenced bumblebee mortality and sucrose consumption respectively. *C. bombi*, thiamethoxam dosage, and their interaction were included as fixed factors and bee size was included as a covariate. Colony of origin was included as a random factor. Parasite count was logged (log\\textsubscript{10}) to improve model fit and analysed using a linear mixed effect model with thiamethoxam dosages, with bee size included as a covariant, and colony of origin included as a random factor.\n\nWe used the packages `drc`, `MuMIn`, `lme4` & `coxme` [Bates et al. 2015, Ritz et al. 2015, Barton 2016, Therneau 2018]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.739,r=0.484,b=0.935); page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.068,r=0.907,b=0.220), with ID 05c36cd2-101a-47b8-a88c-ed7caa59511e -->\n\n## Results\n\nWe found that the LD\\(_{50}\\) value for thiamethoxam was 6.63 ng when used in isolation compared with 6.82 ng per bumblebee when used in combination with the parasite *C. bombi*, suggesting no observed differences in mortality between infected and uninfected bumblebees (Fig. 1A and B, Coxme, *C. bombi*, Parameter Estimate (ES) = 0.10, Confidence Interval (CI) = -0.11 to 0.33). Bumblebee size had an effect on mortality, but the effect was not linear, with mortality risk increasing for both smaller and larger bees (Fig. 2, Coxme, size, PE = -0.35, CI = -0.60 to -0.11).\n\nWe found no effect of thiamethoxam or *C. bombi* inoculation on sucrose consumption (Fig. 3, Supp Table S2 and S3 [online only]). Interestingly, as thiamethoxam dose increased, this resulted in bumblebees having a higher intensity of *C. bombi* infection (Fig. 4A, lmer, dosage, PE = 0.0047, CI = 0.003-0.006). However, when subjects that died during the experiment were excluded from the analysis there was no effect of thiamethoxam dose on parasite intensity (Fig. 4B, lmer, dosage, PE = 0.001, CI = -0.01 to 0.013), suggesting no effect of thiamethoxam on *C. bombi* intensity at sub-lethal levels. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.246,r=0.907,b=0.515), with ID 11dc2634-ce91-4a57-8527-ea28b6e822e3 -->\n\n## Figure Description\n\n### Title\nThiamethoxam and Crithidia bombi\n\n### Graph A: Thiamethoxam\n- **X-Axis**: Dosage (ng/bee), ranging from 0 to 100.\n- **Y-Axis**: Proportion of mortalities, ranging from 0 to 1.0.\n- **Curve**: A dose-response curve showing the relationship between dosage and mortality.\n- **LD50 Annotation**: \n  - Marked with a red dashed line at approximately 6.63 ng.\n  - Indicates the dosage at which 50% mortality is observed.\n- **Data Points**: Plotted along the curve, showing a steep increase in mortality with increasing dosage.\n\n### Graph B: Thiamethoxam & Crithidia bombi\n- **X-Axis**: Dosage (ng/bee), ranging from 0 to 100.\n- **Y-Axis**: Proportion of mortalities, ranging from 0 to 1.0.\n- **Curve**: A dose-response curve similar to Graph A, showing the relationship between dosage and mortality when bees are inoculated with Crithidia bombi.\n- **LD50 Annotation**: \n  - Marked with a red dashed line at approximately 6.82 ng.\n  - Indicates the dosage at which 50% mortality is observed.\n- **Data Points**: Plotted along the curve, showing a steep increase in mortality with increasing dosage.\n\n### Caption\nFig. 1.

This suggests that contrary to our original hypothesis, the parasite *C. bombi* had no impact on the LD\\(_{50}\\) of thiamethoxam on bumblebees (*B. terrestris*). This is surprising, as the effects of this parasite on bumblebees are context-dependent, and emerge most obviously when bees are exposed to other stressors [Brown et al. 2000, 2003; Yourth et al. 2008]. Interestingly, and in contrast to previously observed results [Kessler et al. 2015, Arce et al. 2018] (but see [Muth et al. 2020]), we found no effect of thiamethoxam exposure on sucrose consumption. Finally, thiamethoxam exposure was seen to increase *C. bombi* intensity, but only at lethal dosages as there was no effect at sub-lethal levels. Our results demonstrate that methodologies currently used within the regulatory process can be modified to consider the interaction effects between multiple environmental stressors on wild bees.\n\nWe found no evidence of interaction effects between thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* on bumblebee mortality. This contrasts with previous studies that have shown that simultaneous exposure to both thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* can reduce bumblebee survival [Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014]. However, Fauser-Misslin et al. (2014) assessed the impact of chronic, sub-lethal thiamethoxam concentrations over 9 wk on queen bumblebee survival, while here we used acute dosages, in a toxicity test with workers. Toxicity tests such as LD\\(_{50}\\) experiments, are important in determining the lethal consequences of agrochemical use, but are not designed to detect more subtle, sub-lethal impacts of agrochemical exposure [Gill et al. 2012, Siviter et al. 2020b, Siviter et al. 2021b]. While our modified LD\\(_{50}\\) protocol can be used to assess how parasites and agrochemicals interact at higher dosages, a failure to conduct sub-lethal assessments of chronic exposure in bumblebees alongside toxicity tests will clearly result in a failure to detect sub-lethal, but significant, effects. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.091,t=0.883,r=0.485,b=0.929); page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.481,r=0.909,b=0.703); page 1 (l=0.514,t=0.706,r=0.909,b=0.927), with ID 55292e1c-4c35-4301-b768-bb4f0ce7f059 -->\n\n## Page Footer\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/reep/article/15/1/1/6064439 by Oxford Economic Papers user on 11 January 2022 <!-- page_footer, from page 1 (l=0.959,t=0.210,r=0.972,b=0.786), with ID 5c7488ec-2bdd-403e-ac45-67252c021a4c -->","chunks":[{"text":"### Page Header\n\n**Environmental Entomology, 2022, Vol. 51, No. 2**","grounding":[{"box":{"l":0.6062500000000001,"t":0.03422413793103448,"r":0.90625,"b":0.04563218390804598},"page":0}],"chunk_type":"page_header","chunk_id":"b70eb0c6-89e1-4472-b722-3f4a650d4f47"},{"text":"## Text Capture\n\nsame procedure but were presented with a 10 μl droplet of sucrose solution (50°Brix).

This suggests that contrary to our original hypothesis, the parasite *C. bombi* had no impact on the LD\\(_{50}\\) of thiamethoxam on bumblebees (*B. terrestris*). This is surprising, as the effects of this parasite on bumblebees are context-dependent, and emerge most obviously when bees are exposed to other stressors [Brown et al. 2000, 2003; Yourth et al. 2008]. Interestingly, and in contrast to previously observed results [Kessler et al. 2015, Arce et al. 2018] (but see [Muth et al. 2020]), we found no effect of thiamethoxam exposure on sucrose consumption. Finally, thiamethoxam exposure was seen to increase *C. bombi* intensity, but only at lethal dosages as there was no effect at sub-lethal levels. Our results demonstrate that methodologies currently used within the regulatory process can be modified to consider the interaction effects between multiple environmental stressors on wild bees.\n\nWe found no evidence of interaction effects between thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* on bumblebee mortality. This contrasts with previous studies that have shown that simultaneous exposure to both thiamethoxam and *C. bombi* can reduce bumblebee survival [Fauser-Misslin et al. 2014]. However, Fauser-Misslin et al. (2014) assessed the impact of chronic, sub-lethal thiamethoxam concentrations over 9 wk on queen bumblebee survival, while here we used acute dosages, in a toxicity test with workers. Toxicity tests such as LD\\(_{50}\\) experiments, are important in determining the lethal consequences of agrochemical use, but are not designed to detect more subtle, sub-lethal impacts of agrochemical exposure [Gill et al. 2012, Siviter et al. 2020b, Siviter et al. 2021b]. While our modified LD\\(_{50}\\) protocol can be used to assess how parasites and agrochemicals interact at higher dosages, a failure to conduct sub-lethal assessments of chronic exposure in bumblebees alongside toxicity tests will clearly result in a failure to detect sub-lethal, but significant, effects.","grounding":[{"box":{"l":0.09125,"t":0.8831728927203065,"r":0.485,"b":0.9288050766283525},"page":1},{"box":{"l":0.51375,"t":0.48103927203065133,"r":0.9087500000000001,"b":0.7025454980842911},"page":1},{"box":{"l":0.51375,"t":0.7063481800766284,"r":0.9087500000000001,"b":0.9269037356321839},"page":1}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"55292e1c-4c35-4301-b768-bb4f0ce7f059"},{"text":"## Page Footer\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/reep/article/15/1/1/6064439 by Oxford Economic Papers user on 11 January 2022","grounding":[{"box":{"l":0.9587499999999999,"t":0.21009818007662837,"r":0.9724999999999999,"b":0.7862045019157088},"page":1}],"chunk_type":"page_footer","chunk_id":"5c7488ec-2bdd-403e-ac45-67252c021a4c"}]}}
