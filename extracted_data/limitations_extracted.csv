524,limitations,"The paper identifies limitations such as the low concentrations of IMD and TMX tested, which may not reflect real-world exposure levels, and the complexity of olfactory coding that complicates generalization of results. It also notes that short exposure durations during foraging may limit observed effects.",The authors mention that the low doses they used may explain why they did not observe the effect they expected. I do not find any mentioning of other limitations in the discussion.,9,LH,"The authors identified two limitations of the study: 
-a lack of sensitivity in the behavioural essay, to detect if TMX have slightly enhanced performance during the LTM test. 
-the low concentration used, compared to Kessler et al 2015 may have limited  the expected enhancement in olfactory learning.",4,ER,"Key terms: The, It",Key terms: The,"Key terms: The, Kessler"
512,limitations,"The paper discusses limitations in research on bumble bees and wild pollinators, including insufficient worker bee numbers for the 8 mg kg^{-1} treatment, high spinosad concentrations that may not represent realistic exposure levels, and the drying process of spinosad pollen potentially underestimating toxicity. It also highlights challenges in assessing the impact of decreased foraging ability due to varying resource availability and the inadequacy of current pesticide testing protocols that overlook sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior in adult bees exposed during their larval stage.",The paper does not highlight any limitations.,2,LH,,,,"Key terms: The, It",Key terms: The,

658,limitations,"The paper identifies several limitations in research on neonicotinoids, particularly the insufficient understanding of their effects on honeybee intake preferences and social behaviors like trophallaxis. It notes a lack of comprehensive studies and data to support claims about the impact of these pesticides, which presents a barrier to fully assessing their effects on bee health.",no limitations were highlighted by the authors,1,ER,,,,"Key terms: The, It",no limitations were highlighted by the authors,
657,limitations,"The paper discusses limitations related to the inability to replicate the five treatment levels due to the large scale of the feeding experiment, which may affect the reliability of the findings. It also notes the recording of climatic conditions but does not elaborate on their potential impact, indicating another barrier to the research.","In the chronic exposure experiment, the authors mention that the lack of replicates was due to the large scale of the experiment.",6,ER,,,,"Key terms: The, It",Key terms: In,
664,limitations,"The paper identifies multiple limitations to research, including uncertainty about the mechanisms of neonicotinoid effects on bees, variability in field exposure across crops and seasons, and potential long-term consequences for bee populations. It questions the appropriateness of using honeybees as model organisms for assessing risks to other bee species, highlights limitations in solitary bee nesting due to site availability, and discusses methodological biases from the inability to blind data collectors.","The limitation of the study is the inherent complexity of a field study, in addition to this the authors highlight the follwowing limitations: the lack of blindness to treatment during the wild bee density survey, the low statistical power in the bumblebee experiment (counting cocoons) and the fact that that they did not quantify the pathogens and parasites before placing the bumblebees colonies (although they could be infested) and this could have added unexplained noise to the data.",5,ER,,,,"Key terms: The, It",Key terms: The,
663,limitations,"The paper identifies limitations such as high costs, time consumption, lack of precision, low repeatability due to environmental factors, logistical challenges in sampling, inadequacy of existing bioassays, and the complexity of honey bee colony dynamics. It emphasizes the need for improved methods and relevant secondary endpoints to better assess the ecological and economic impacts of pesticide exposure on honey bee colonies.","The main limitation lies in the inherent complexity of a field study, including the interaction with real environmental factors  that can make the interpretation difficult. The authors note that their physiological measures  have limited comparability with other studies,as they are often conducted  at single indiviudal level rather than sampled at the colony level.",7,ER,,,,"Key terms: The, It","Key terms: The, The",
