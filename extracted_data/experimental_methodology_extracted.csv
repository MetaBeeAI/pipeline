664,experimental_methodology,The experimental methodologies used in this paper included: 1) Field experiments with bees placed in oilseed rape fields at specific growth stages; 2) Monitoring of bee activity and flower cover; 3) Placement of trap nests for solitary bees to observe nesting behavior; 4) Collection of pollen and nectar samples from bees to analyze pesticide exposure.,"This is a field study and the authors tested the follwing in 20 pairs of matched fields: density of wild bees (solitary bees and bumblebees); Osmia cornuta nesting activity (by placing cocoons and after emergence counting the brood cells); Bombus terrestris colony health (measuring colony weight and production of queen and male cocoons); honeybee colony strength (by counting the number of adult bees per colony). Vegetation, Pollen and nectar samples were collected to measure pesticide concentrations.",5,ER,,,,"Key terms: The, Field, Monitoring, Placement, Collection","Key terms: This, Osmia, Bombus, Vegetation, Pollen",
663,experimental_methodology,"The experimental methodologies used in this paper include:
1. Inducing varying levels of insecticide stress in bee colonies by administering imidacloprid and fenoxycarb.
2. Setting up artificial swarms of bees and allowing them to develop before exposure.
3. Controlled exposure of colonies to insecticides in a semi-field environment using tents.
4. Measuring various biological indicators such as the number of bees, brood amounts, honey and pollen quantities, and physiological indicators like vitellogenin concentration and enzyme activities.
5. Using the Liebefeld method for estimating colony strength and other sampling techniques for assessing the health of the colonies.
6. Analyzing insecticide residues in honey and comb samples using LC-MS/MS.","One, eight and 38 weeks after pesticides exposure ﻿, 33 measurements were performed on the colonies: ﻿the number of bees and of open and capped brood cells, 
the amounts of honey and pollen present in the hives (estimated by the Liebefeld-method), as well as on indicators of insecticide-induced stress from samples of hive bees, foragers, brood and hemolymph. The ndicators included  all vital functions of the honeybee colony﻿ included indicators known or assumed to be linked to the age and health status of foragers (size of hypopharyngeal gland-acini, metabolic and immune enzymes), to the quality of brood rearing (chemical composition of brood and jelly, fluctuating asymmetry in adults), and to the health and immune status of hive bees (hemolymph vitellogenin, immune enzymes, ovary development and survival in a cage test).
In autumn, samples of honey and comb were tested for pesticides residues using ﻿LC-MS/MS",8,ER,,,,"Key terms: The, Inducing, Setting, Controlled, Measuring","Key terms: One, Liebefeld, The, In",
370,experimental_methodology,The experimental methodologies used in this paper included: 1) Conducting homing flight tests on honeybee foragers to assess the effects of thiamethoxam; 2) Infesting colonies with *Varroa destructor* mites and assessing their impact on homing success; 3) Using RFID technology to track the movements of bees; 4) Administering thiamethoxam at various sublethal doses in a controlled feeding setup; 5) Monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature during the experiments; 6) Evaluating the health status of the colonies prior to experimentation.,"The paper performed an homing flight test using the RFID device to assess the homing success following oral exposure to sublethal doses of thiamethoxam. Other parameters were measured, including Varroa infestation level, mean temperature, Nosema and DWV infection level, to be used a covariates",8,FS,,,,"Key terms: The, Conducting, Infesting, Varroa, Using","Key terms: The, Other, Varroa, Nosema",

Four tents were used for the treated (maize derived by seed treated) and two plots for the control (maize crop derived by untreated seeds). In the first experiment, there is also one plot with and one without artificial water. During the experiment several parameters have been collected: 1) bee mortality; 2) flight activity and bee behaviours; 3) brood development; 4) residues in guttation and dead bees",7,FS,,,,"Key terms: The, Two, Treatment, Daily, Monitoring","Key terms: Two, Four, In, During",
